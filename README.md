# 1. Project Overview

Ubisoft Entertainment is a French video game publisher headquartered in Paris, France. It is known for publishing games for several acclaimed video game franchises, including Assassinâ€™s Creed, Just Dance, Far Cry, For Honor, and more.

This is a simulated school project based on a real A/B Test at Ubisoft, focusing on the For Honor game's Buy Now page. The redesign aims to simplify the buying process by reducing the need for scrolling and minimizing clicks. The goal is to increase customer conversions.

## a. The Buy Now page before the testing phase:

</p>

User Journey:
- The user on the Buy Now page would first have to select the preferred version of the game from the five versions displayed on the screen.
- The user was then expected to scroll down and select the platform on which they would play.
- The final step was the Place Your Order button that took them to the checkout page on the Ubisoft store.

## b. The New Test Variation:

</p>

- In the redesigned test layout, the section to choose edition, console, as well as the Order Now step were moved to the top of the left column, with an edition comparison.
- The new design eliminated scroll and improved the interaction time/rate on the Buy now page.
