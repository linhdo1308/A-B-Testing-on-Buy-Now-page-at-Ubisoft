## 1. Project Overview

Ubisoft Entertainment is a French video game publisher headquartered in Paris, France. It is known for publishing games for several acclaimed video game franchises, including Assassin’s Creed, Just Dance, Far Cry, For Honor, and more.

This is a simulated school project based on a real A/B Test at Ubisoft, focusing on the For Honor game's Buy Now page. The redesign aims to simplify the buying process by reducing the need for scrolling and minimizing clicks. The goal is to increase customer conversions.

### a. The Buy Now page before the testing phase:

</p>

User Journey:
- The user on the Buy Now page would first have to select the preferred version of the game from the five versions displayed on the screen.
- The user was then expected to scroll down and select the platform on which they would play.
- The final step was the Place Your Order button that took them to the checkout page on the Ubisoft store.

### b. The New Test Variation:

</p>

- In the redesigned test layout, the section to choose edition, console, as well as the Order Now step were moved to the top of the left column, with an edition comparison.
- The new design eliminated scroll and improved the interaction time/rate on the Buy now page.

## 2. Test Design
### a. A/B Test Details
- Conversion Definition: For this test, a conversion is defined as a completed purchase.
- Minimum Effect of Interest (MEI): The MEI is defined as a 1 percentage point increase in conversions, on an absolute basis.
- Unit of conversion = user
- Hypothesis:
-   Null hypothesis: The new design has no impact on conversation rate.
-   Alternative hypothesis: The new design increases the conversation rate by at least 1%.


### b. Experimental Design
- alpha = 0.05
- power = 0.8
- sample size = 6263 (per group) (allocation = 50%)
- test duration = 24 days

Note: The sample size and test duration are calculated based on simulated historical data

Assumptions: no seasonal effect during the test (campaign promotion, weekly seasonality, …)

Users will be randomly assigned to either the control group (existing design) or the treatment group (new design) to ensure unbiased comparisons.

## 3. Result
After running the simulated A/B testing, there is an increase of 1.4% in conversion rate when using the new design. According to the z-test result, this difference is statistically difference.

The next step can be discussing the result with stakeholders and agreeing on a ship/no-ship decision
