# Ubisoft A/B Test ‚Äî For Honor Buy Now Page Optimization

## 1. Project Overview

**Ubisoft Entertainment** is a French video game publisher headquartered in Paris, France, known for major franchises such as *Assassin‚Äôs Creed*, *Just Dance*, *Far Cry*, and *For Honor*.

This is a **simulated A/B testing project** based on a real Ubisoft experiment that increased lead generation rates by **12%**.  
The goal is to **optimize the ‚ÄúBuy Now‚Äù page** for *For Honor* by simplifying the purchase flow ‚Äî reducing scrolling and clicks ‚Äî to improve customer conversions.

### a. Original ‚ÄúBuy Now‚Äù Page (Before Testing)

</p>

**User Journey:**
1. The user selects the preferred version of the game from five displayed editions.
2. The user scrolls down to choose their platform (e.g., PlayStation, Xbox, PC).
3. Finally, they click **‚ÄúPlace Your Order‚Äù** to proceed to checkout on the Ubisoft store.

This multi-step process required **excessive scrolling** and **extra clicks**, which likely reduced conversion rates.

</p>

**Key Improvements:**
- Combined edition, console, and ‚ÄúOrder Now‚Äù options at the **top left** for easier access.  
- Added an **edition comparison section** for quicker decision-making.  
- Eliminated the need to scroll, improving **interaction speed** and **user experience**.

## 2. Test Design

### üß™ a. A/B Test Details
- **Conversion Definition:** A completed purchase  
- **Minimum Effect of Interest (MEI):** +1 percentage point in conversion rate (absolute)  
- **Unit of Conversion:** User  

**Hypotheses:**
- *Null (H‚ÇÄ):* The new design has no impact on conversion rate  
- *Alternative (H‚ÇÅ):* The new design increases conversion rate by at least 1%

### b. Experimental Setup
| Parameter | Value |
|------------|--------|
| Œ± (Significance level) | 0.05 |
| Power (1 - Œ≤) | 0.8 |
| Sample Size | 6,263 users per group |
| Allocation | 50% control / 50% treatment |
| Test Duration | 24 days |

**Assumptions:**
